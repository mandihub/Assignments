        Umngqusho [umŋǃʱuʃo] is a Bantu dish with several variants:

        Made of stamp mielies (samp) with sugar beans, butter, onions, potatoes, chillies and lemons, made to simmer.
        Made of mielie-meal, semolina and peas.
        A Xhosa variant made with "samp and beans" that is served with butter or fat was apparently         Nelson Mandela's favourite dish.[1]

        It’s true when they say you can leave the rural life and go to the city but your roots will never leave you.  That’s the case with Umphokoqo, better known as African salad.  It is a dish best served in the Summer and does not require much preparation. This dish is versatile in that Xhosas serve it with sour milk whereas Zulus and Sothos serve it with stew.

        Now let me take you through my experience with this dish……

        Growing up on a farm cows were milked everyday and that meant we ate Umphokoqo on a daily basis. We had it for breakfast, lunch and supper.  It was dished up in a big bowl and four        children had to share two spoons i.e. two boys and two girls.  There was a big competition        you had to eat pretty fast and pass the spoon, the boys used to beat us.  As you can      imagine boys eat faster than girls.  Because I had it everyday I just hated it as a teenager and as a young adult.  However, I have recently made a conscious decision to start eating umphokoqo again……….whenever I think of this dish I just remember the good times on the farm.

        Pap is a traditional dish that is native to South Africans; the dish is made from softly grounded maize, which is then cooked to the chef’s desired idea of the meal that they have in mind. However grounded maize may be found in other parts of the world as well, and just differs in name. In the West, pap is better known as polenta or grits, and in East Africa it is known as ugali.


        The word pap is Dutch (similar to South Africa’s Afrikaans language), and simply means “porridge” in English. South African pap is found in most of South Africa’s poorest provinces because it is inexpensive, and it serves as one of the country’s most staple foods.

        Each ethnic group in South Africa calls pap by a different name; the BaPedi people in Limpopo call it “bogobe”, the Zulu people in KwaZulu Natal call it “phuthu” and the Xhosa people in the Eastern Cape call it “ipapa”. It does not matter what you call pap, what matters is how it is made!

        In traditional villages, South African pap is cooked outside in a black cast-ion pot, and the fire that it is cooked on gives the pap a good smoky taste. The fire also assists the pap to cook faster than it would on an electric or gas stove.
